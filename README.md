# Advent Of Code 2016

Kotlin tests and solutions for the [2016 puzzles](http://adventofcode.com/2016).

I'm an Android developer who has dabbled with Kotlin intermittently in side projects. Just as with Python [last year](https://github.com/stkent/AdventOfCode2015), my focus was on learning more about my chosen language and its ecosystem!

# Objectives

- Continue to explore the Kotlin standard library;
- Focus on producing communicative, idiomatic, and well-structured solutions over high-performance solutions;
- Write high-quality tests using one of the popular Kotlin testing libraries, [KotlinTest](https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest).

# Instructions

## Running Tests

All days:

    ./gradlew test

Specific day, e.g. 14:

    ./gradlew day14:test

## Verifying Solutions

Individual IntelliJ IDEA run configurations for each day are included in this repository and should be available for use after importing the project. Code was originally written using IntelliJ IDEA 2016.3.1, Build #IU-163.9166.29.

Note that some solutions include manual scratch work. The code for those days may only solve a subset of the original problem.

Note too that a few solutions take O(hours) to run.
